Hello, do you have a large media library that you would enjoy more if you chould open files at random?
If so, this might be perfect for you.
It requires:
  python 3.X
  Windows or
  Unix-like OS with xdg-open
  
randomFile.py hasn't been tested on a Mac, but might work anyways.

This program now features both a tkinter GUI and command-line options
Open the GUI from the command line with:
  $ python3 /path/to/randomFile.py
 Command-line usage:
  # python3 /path/to/randomFile.py /path/to/directory1 [/path/to/directory2 /path/to/directory3 ...] [-e|-i] [ext1 ext2 ext3 ...]
