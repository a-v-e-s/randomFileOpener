<p>Hello, do you have a large media library that you would enjoy more if you chould open files at random?<br/>
If so, this might be perfect for you.<br/>
It requires: python 3.X, Windows, or Unix-like OS with xdg-open<br/>
randomFile.py hasn't been tested on a Mac, but might work anyways.<br/>
This program now features both a tkinter GUI and command-line options.<br/></p>

<p>Open the GUI from the command line with:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;$ python3 /path/to/randomFile.py<br/>
Command-line usage:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;$ python3 /path/to/randomFile.py /path/to/directory1 [/path/to/directory2 /path/to/directory3 ...] [-e|-i] [ext1 ext2 ext3 ...]
