Hello!
Do you have a large media library that you would enjoy more if you chould open files at random?
If so, this might be perfect for you!
It requires:
  python 3.X
  Windows or
  Unix-like OS with xdg-open
  
randomFile.py hasn't been tested on a Mac, but might work anyways.

This program now features a tkinter GUI!
Open it from the command line with:
  $ python3 /path/to/randomFile.py
  
The usage is self-explanatory and a Help button is included
