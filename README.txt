Hello!
Do you have a large media library that you would enjoy more if you chould open files at random?
If so, this script might be perfect for you!
It requires:
  python 3.X
  Unix-like OS with xdg-open
  
Open it from the command line with:
  $ python3 randomFile.py
  
The usage is self-explanatory.
This repository is a work in progress.
I'm an amateur and still learning python.
New features and support for other Operating systems are in the works...
